I've finally rebuilt the camera rig for my prototype, and this time I've managed to not destroy anything! 
Everything works and I've also calibrated the shaders to work properly and it all looks amazing, great to finally get it all up and running. I will have another post up tomorrow about getting it all calibrated and some videos of it in use, just need to do a bit of video editing first.

Here's the webcam's.
