A major source of inspiration for this project is a series of artworks called Vision Machines by the Austrian Artist Alfons Shilling created during the 1970's. Shilling created many contraptions that completely altered the pereptual field in fundamental ways. (pictured below is one of his pieces which allows you view the world as if your eyes were one foot apart).

I want to further this dedicated enquiry into the digital domain, and build a digital layer between the outside world and our perceptions, and explore the possibilities of altering the perceptual field. The crucial instrument in this layer will be an Oculus Rift, and a stereo camera rig to be attached to it. (I will be mimicking the rig developed by Will Steptoe at UCL, who kindly gave me the 3D models he developed for his project [AR-Rift](http://willsteptoe.com/post/66968953089/ar-rift-part-1))

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BbDZTKxXGQ) is a screen capture from my first prototype, testing two image feeds through the oculus rift, with a simple posterise shader applied to the image. Developed in C++ using the openFrameworks library.
