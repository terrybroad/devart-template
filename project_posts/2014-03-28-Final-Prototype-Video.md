So right in the nick of time, I've finished shooting and editing the video of the final prototype in action.

For this prototype the only input controlling any effects is an mp3 loaded into the program itself, in a final implementation there would be many different triggers, and it would be picking up ambient sound not music loaded into the program; but this works well for the purposes of demonstration.
It's been a really exciting and productive couple of months and I can't believe its all come to an end. And whatever happens I've had a lot of fun working on this project.
